      // Explanation:
      // The first rendering happens in the server. Therefore, when this code runs,
      // the server makes a request to itself (running the code below) in order to
      // get the current page props and use that response to render the HTML.
      // The browser shows this HTML and rehydrates the application, turning it into
      // a normal SPA. After that, subsequent route navigation runs this code below
      // from the browser and get the new page props, which is this time rendered
      // directly in the browser, as opposed to the first page rendering.

      try {
        // Get our page props from our custom API:
        const res = await fetch(
          `${baseUrl}/api/getProps?path=${encodeURIComponent(to.path)}&name=${
            to.name
